This report is one of three projects necessary for my bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering. It focuses on an in-depth study of the Ariane V propulsion system accompanied by a preliminary reverse sizing to verify and comment the choices taken when designing the Ariane V. Specifically, I was tasked with the section regarding the propulsion system of the James Webb Space Telescope and it's main advantages and drawbacks.
